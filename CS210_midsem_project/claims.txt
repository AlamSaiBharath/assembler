1. The assembler:

I have tested three examples shown below. The errors only occurred in the file errorhandling.asm and 
the program immediately stopped on the second pass. 

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced three output files, a listing file, 
error log file and machine-readable object file for each example.

#Input: test1.asm
#Output: 
a. test1.l 
b. test1.log (without any error messages)
c. test1.o

#Input: test2.asm
#Output: 
a. test2.l 
b. test2.log (without any error messages)
